# BREACH: architecture, art pipeline, build and test

**Current implementation (2026-10-19):** The owner approved heavy rounds and three-shot salvos, per-ship colours, left/right/paired/rest batteries, stronger player fire, Vesper/Latch for Circuit, a new power chooser and difficulty tuning. These changes are implemented on `codex/space-combat-apk`. The owner subsequently delegated remaining design decisions and requested a new princess/Yeti encounter, full documentation, commit/push and an APK. Frost Warden is integrated and locally verified as the fifth chapter; Brum remains an ally. Read `docs/CONTINUE_HERE.md`, `docs/SPACE_COMBAT_HANDOFF.md`, `docs/BRUM_LEVEL_PLAN.md` and `docs/MOBILE_PREVIEW.md` for current mechanics and verified release status. Older review gates and localhost checkpoints below are historical. No new CI success is claimed until recorded in the release document.

**Historical cannon correction before implementation (2026-10-19):** The owner rejected the4189 weapon studies. Enemy cannon fire must cross the intact brick field and threaten the paddle/craft, without breaking bricks or releasing their rewards. Carrier currently damages enemy-hit panels; Circuit/Forge currently absorb shots on cover. These behaviours must change in the approved implementation, while preserving player brick collisions and keeping Carrier boarding threats active. Circuit's centre is an exit iris, with no suction mechanic; the replacement presentation keeps it quiet until departure. The revised cannon comparison is at4190, stronger friendly skiff deployment/fire at4191, and reference-backed distinct companion proposals are recorded alongside them. See `design/phase1/weapon-vfx-v3-review.md`. The4188 playable checkpoint remains unchanged; visual approval is still required before implementation, commit/push or APK work. The previous4189 quality receipts certify only that historical study, which is now rejected.

**Replacement weapon motion review (2026-10-19):** The rejected Hard boards are superseded by two moving visual candidates at <http://127.0.0.1:4189/>: A Magnetic breacher and B Reactor rupture. Both use original cannon/ship art, complete rendered charge clips and actual machined payload PNGs, with distinct launch/recoil/travel and staged source-panel impact. The initially regular B fracture was revised to five unequal jagged metal pieces. Independent review covers12 family/phone/cannon combinations,132 phase PNGs, controls and full cycles with zero browser/network errors. All14 protected source/build hashes and four served4188 routes remain unchanged. Final movies decode at1240x1000 /5.209s with distinct frames. See `design/phase1/weapon-vfx-v2-review.md`, permanent candidate media in `design/phase1/weapon-vfx-v2/review/`, and `out/weapon-vfx-v2/qa/final/QA.md`. The734-file archive preserves candidates and rejected drafts. These are visual studies; owner approval still gates gameplay, tuning, commit/push and APK work. Desktop timings/memory are not handset performance admission.

**Current selected effects and power limits (2026-10-18):** Ship A magnetic extraction/plasma and Kit B single-row Quick Volley are implemented in the4188 review hub. Kit offers real Brick Ward, Arrows, canonical Cosmic and Ball Fan while retaining the face control. All three space levels use slower18/22/26 banked hit/active-second charging. Companion casts and ball pickups now obey mode caps:12/9/5 live balls,2/2/1 simultaneous Cosmic,20/18/14 maximum remaining special seconds. Saturated choices keep charge. All196 units,24 actual Main phone/mode cases (including66 Kit check groups), required polish/layout and compact mobile UI pass with zero page errors. Six coarse earned Easy attempts win with3lives; they are not human balance. Exact builds, screenshots and receipts are sealed in `out/space-selected-review/final-report.json`. The owner rejected both subsequent Hard laser/lance/battery boards as stale and visually mismatched. Their replacement is an isolated moving weapon study using the original cannon art and new rendered payloads; gameplay implementation remains explicitly withheld until the owner approves the visuals. Current normal plasma still uses the existing3.5u collision core. See `design/phase1/space-selected-review.md`. Older4186/4187 and the delivered APK are unchanged; no new gameplay commit/push or APK is implied.

**Historical pacing revision before the selected FX/Kit build:** The owner finds the six-hit space-power revision too short. All three space levels now bank18/22/26 ordinary damage credits and fill the orb over at least18/22/26 active combat seconds; shots/cosmic balls cannot recharge themselves. WIDE stacks width and time, other positive durations add, ball fan adds ordinary survivors, and canonical cosmic artwork is restored. Actual paddle artwork now widens with its collider while preserving chrome ends. The pacing-only hub is127.0.0.1:4187; older4186 and the APK remain frozen. Three level owners supplied earned Easy routes and native render proofs; scripted durations are not human balance. All183 units, final18 Main phone/mode cases, required polish/layout and compact mobile UI pass with zero page errors; exact artifacts are sealed in `out/space-polish-review/final-report.json`. Two ship-effect proposals and two Kit menu proposals have been shown, with owner picks still pending. New suction/cannon FX and live Kit power choices are therefore not yet built. See `design/phase1/space-polish-review.md` for rules, receipts and limits. No commit/push: the latest message both authorizes push and then asks to wait; resolve that after the complete result is reviewable.

**Historical six-hit space revision (superseded by the current pacing revision):** The owner rejects the earlier Circuit/Forge Easy balance as a precision/patience grind. New review candidates retain the selected visual families but provide broad mothership damage, equal-sized coloured panels, fewer grey pieces and Nix in all three space levels. Six productive ordinary damage contacts earn a paused three-choice picker: ten-second LASER, ten-second UNSTOPPABLE, or fill the live set to5 ordinary balls. Shots/TITAN do not self-recharge. Closed Forge machinery takes damage; Circuit drops the ordered-symbol gate and retains an earned skiff burst; ordinary ship metal hits remain productive. Carrier retains crew urgency and uses a curved connected tractor beam and matching pull. Shared input resets prevent stale taps/Space from launching; pause Retry stays. New browser review hub is127.0.0.1:4186, with all three modes per level; older4184/4185 and the delivered native APK stay frozen. All171 tests and the local build pass. Final18 actual Main CDP cases cover three levels ×three modes ×both phones, with visible Nix, choice/cancel, frozen clocks, powers, pause and Retry; zero page errors. Required polish/layout and compact mobile UI pass. Exact final artifacts are Carrier9f772abdf382, Circuit983c8c0328d0, Forge7c8df65c5f23; sealed hashes, gallery and receipts are in `out/space-power-review/final-report.json`. Circuit/Forge coarse Easy public-input-assisted completions with earned choices are separate evidence, not human balance. Carrier curved-motion media is explicitly staged. Full rules and receipt links: `design/phase1/space-powers-review.md`. This supersedes earlier balance/target rules, not the approved artwork. No gameplay commit/push or new APK approval.

**Artwork preservation:** `artwork-library/` now preserves750 unique originals/asset records (770 source aliases/versions, 288042628 bytes), with a complete catalogue, full SHA256 manifest and preserved A/B/C/D space-board gallery. See `docs/ARTWORK_LIBRARY.md` and `artwork-library/README.md`; AGENTS.md links the folder and requires `python tools/archive_artwork.py` after adding artwork. Copies are byte-exact, duplicates share one copy, and changed sources create new versions; historical rejected concepts remain labelled. Working manifests/render scripts stay at their existing paths. The archive is local until an approved push or separate backup.

**Historical selected space reviews (superseded by later owner difficulty feedback):** Owner-selected Circuit Breakout Level2 and Shutter Forge Level3 are now actual-art playable isolated candidates. Circuit HTML `9115383E4F4963F86C11A7063A07A50B10FC1B7347F5425AC4C972D39202FDCE`, sourceEEB862BC…, is served at127.0.0.1:4184/circuit.html?level=1&difficulty=medium. Forge HTML `E8F06046E4B224C1EF790F59F4124661583ABC1F5D141583ED0B44A46118F97F`, source89B1E8A1…, is served at127.0.0.1:4185/forge.html?level=1&difficulty=medium. Both use fresh Main controls, house fonts, real Resume/Retry/Menu and semantic result titles; previews have no companion/pilot/captive art. All147 configured tests pass, including20 independent new-level regressions. Both packed previews pass actual Chromium phone-size touch, pause, Retry, geometry and visual checks with zero page errors. Circuit earned runs win50.2667s iPhone /28.0417s Android, three lives: both use the selected intrinsic flight burst, Android also naturally collects SPLIT/LASER. Forge strict ordinary completions are162.88s iPhone /260.0417s Android, three lives, no optional capsule/TITAN/Continue; Android uses a legitimate wall-bank input policy. Earlier failed policies remain retained. These are scripted route proofs, not human balance or physical-device performance. Actual motion fixtures are explicitly staged. Details: `design/phase1/relay-circuit.md`, `orbital-forge.md`; independent review: `out/next-level-review/REVIEW.md`; phone galleries: `out/selected-levels-review/`. Human screenshot/play OK is still required before gameplay commit/push, permanent registry admission or a new APK. Existing frozen F8EB pause-Retry checkpoint4183 and delivered APK remain unchanged. The final local `npm run build` also passes at `EB70331AD2A520D35E9DFB0EDF4F6539D68CD455ACF814D70920061D7B780547`; it includes the shared no-core charge guard but retains only the existing two menu levels. Phone review receipts belong to their exact frozen previews above, not an untested new APK.

**Pause Retry checkpoint (2026-10-18):** Owner explicitly requests Retry inside pause. Current Main uses the existing fresh constructor on the same level/difficulty; Continue/ad/result/input state and the frame origin reset while saved stars/preferences stay intact. Three stacked Resume/Retry/Menu buttons fit both phone safe areas. Two independent regressions and12 real CDP cases (Carrier/Vault ×three modes ×both phone sizes) pass with zero page errors on exact HTML SHA256 `F8EB9BE20BDD854546944BF941CBB139FE97887505094A46B33732FAA6ECB9E0`. Frozen review is `out/pause-retry/browser/breach.html`, served at127.0.0.1:4183/breach.html?difficulty=medium. Evidence: `out/retry-review/final/report.json` and `out/retry-review/REVIEW.md`. This proves the two existing menu levels; selected Circuit/Forge will need the same real-input checks after their isolated build is ready. No new gameplay commit/push or APK change.

**Owner human balance feedback (2026-10-18):** The owner finds earlier BA5E Carrier too easy and Vault too hard, then selects a MIX of boosted retreat and finite rebuilding siege. That choice is implemented in the new review candidate; the old pure A/B choice is closed. Easy/Medium/Hard share controls and the lower reaction lane. Vault locomotion/chew multipliers are0.60/0.80/1.00; warning, venom, cage and ball/input timing stay intact. Hard Carrier is a development setting pending calibration, not approved balance. No new gameplay commit/push approval has been given.

**Latest selection and tested candidate (2026-10-18):** Production HTML SHA256 `19376ED445F4D89CEA02CFF8733A5255DA14FD275DA3CAD9798155AA64516AA1` adds the selected hybrid to Boarding Raid: finite distinct manifests, active per-manifest jump clocks, permanent archived rescues, six-contact manual Nix, larger target-facing fighters, visible hull motion/engines, safe rebuilding and final boosted retreat or disabled cleanup. All128 units pass. Production two-phone real-input lifecycle checks, required polish/layout and compact mobile UI pass with zero page errors. Separately sealed isolated HTML `4F808C2A682885F6415325CBC89B064D63939FF277912ABD859D5AD048BC457D` uses identical gameplay source plus embedded fonts/read-only trajectory planning. At120Hz public level input, ordinary Easy wins40.400/42.700s; Medium ten-rescue wins109.725/125.600s, three lives, no pickups/Nix/Continue. These are scripted route proofs, not human balance, DOM routing or performance proof. Hard75s/8.5s has no strict ordinary full-clear admission; failed attempts and an unadopted90s/10s experiment are preserved. A separate bounded earned-Nix proof readies at8.667/12.325s with nine authored rescues remaining; iPhone cast run wins, Android cast run disables the hull then controller-times-out in cleanup, not a victory (`out/carrier-hybrid/nix-earned-report.json`). Primary changes remain uncommitted pending owner play/screenshot OK. Evidence: `out/carrier-hybrid/evidence.json`, `out/hybrid-review/production-decoded/report.json`, `out/carrier-hybrid/mobile-ui/report.json`. Earlier BA5E and4181 remain frozen history.

**Parallel levels authorized (2026-10-18):** The selected Circuit A and Forge A mechanics, source-faithful machinery families, actual moving collision and independent phone reviews are delivered as described above. Escort Run B and Orbital Switch B remain distinct later directions, numbers unassigned. Original B/C rescue prototypes are historical; selected design/source geometry and collision are authoritative now. The C lower hull lip remains physical: Forge uses its visibly deployed exterior reactor. Circuit uses four empty phase stations, real split-metal firing ports and one earned skiff burst; Forge uses three timed stabilisers, collapse, once-only ordinary three-ball reward and quiet external-reactor finish. No extra cast or permanent registry/progress migration is included. All new gameplay remains uncommitted pending owner approval.

**APK checkpoint delivered (2026-10-18):** Separate `codex/carrier-mobile-preview` CI [39129140498](https://github.com/mahikshith/breaker/actions/runs/39129140498) completed successfully on native fix47bc6b3. Actual APK artifact12137681701 is downloaded and verified at `../breaker-mobile-preview/out/carrier-apk-delivery/39129140498/apk/BREACH-Carrier-preview.apk` (2,431,097bytes, SHA256 `7F5468197BB6333BF5AACEBE4CF4226048D043634BCA8829B6644042C4F2E10D`). Web44units/six suites, native build/lint and lifecycle instrumentation pass; actual recreation captures show full1080×2400 content. Frozen gameplay F4863DC5… and packaged HTML4D5D7B5E… remain exact. Delivery documentation commitf72e7ccf follows tested47bc6b3 and is pushed as the owner. APK excludes Boarding Raid, Nix/Tick, difficulty/hybrid and B/C. Physical phone performance remains for owner testing. This checkpoint authorization does not approve primary gameplay commit/push or merging main.


**Historical A/B asset milestone (2026-10-18):** real independent PNG parts and the isolated Canvas motion assembly are complete for the approved A/B left playfields. Final proof is under `out/space-assets-ab/final/`: `A-ios-reference.png`, `A-android-reference.png`, `B-ios-reference.png`, `B-android-reference.png`, `A-motion.gif`, `B-motion.gif` and `asset-report.json`. Actual 393×852/412×915 images and sampled launch/release/boarding/iris sequences pass independent visual review; all four capture runs report zero page errors, real alpha/metadata checks and approximately 126 CSS paddle reserve. A has five shallow captive windows; B has four large worker pods. This asset-only milestone contains no companions, pilots or portraits and predates the latest Nix/Tick selection. These are asset-motion proofs with a placement ball, not new gameplay: runtime admission/WebP sizing, actual-alpha collision alignment, input/combat/rescue/power rules, full playable phone runs, memory/performance and new APK checks remain. The proof milestone retains EA839F00… as its gameplay baseline; it does not cover later Carrier integration. Reproduction and limits: `art/space/ASSETS_AB.md`; inventory/contracts: `design/phase1/space-assets-ab-spec.md` and `space-assets-ab.json`.

## 1. Aim and goal

- **Product:** BREACH, a premium brick breaker for iOS and Android, portrait only. The tagline is "Break in. Break out."
- **Current goal:** deliver the isolated frozen Carrier APK while the owner reviews the new Boarding Raid browser candidate. Preserve Vault, keep B/C isolated and maintain the evidence/scope split above.
  - **Invasion:** Arkanoid crossed with Space Invaders.
  - **The Vault:** a rescue race against a serpent.
- **Later:** a story mode and unlockables, planned in `docs/STORY_PLAN.md`. Nothing for those is built yet.
- **Reference games:** BALL x PIT, Arkanoid, Space Invaders.

The mobile baseline constructs both levels with the actual UI scale before creating the paddle/serve: `paddleY = round(max(minY,H-126/scale))`, drain=paddle+20u, shield=paddle+18u. `Arena.drawHUDBase` owns the compact top lives/AIM/18CSS Lilita score; Vault draws its danger strip. Kit drawing/power remains `coreMode === 'ward'` only; Carrier uses manual Nix through the same numeric52CSS orb hit test. Invasion retains earned centre-return Titan. `aimReadySeen` persists the single caught-ball press hint; the bottom track, repeated coaching and power chips are removed. World debris/drop/bolt clipping keeps the lower input area clear.

Verified Carrier integration: 125u physical/visible base paddle at natural height about 17u, ordinary ball 7.5r and TITAN 10r. Vault retains70×12u/default6r. Shared constructor options preserve the selected ordinary radius through serve/split/burst and TITAN expiry. Both-phone tip overlays match visible alpha within 0.006 CSS px; actual bundled gameplay and power checks pass. Carrier-only full-viewport background drawing replaces safe-inset row stretching; settled results suppress frozen Carrier effects. Human balance and native performance remain to verify.

The isolated `breaker-mobile-preview` worktree on `codex/carrier-mobile-preview` retains the frozen Carrier checkpoint, offline fonts and native full-window/safe-inset/stop-resume/recreation checks. Its native fixes are pushed and CI is active as recorded above. The previously delivered APK is older; new Boarding Raid/Nix/Tick are excluded. See that branch's `docs/MOBILE_PREVIEW.md` for verified run/artifact status.
- **Business model (placeholder):** watch an ad to continue, or a one-time "Unlock full game" purchase. The option to make the whole game free is kept open: `MODE = 'free'` in `src/monetize.js`.

## 2. Runtime architecture

```

### Key conventions

- **Coordinates:** world units with y pointing down. The play area is 360 wide.
  - Everything in a level is drawn in world coordinates.
  - `main.js` translates the canvas by `inT`, so y = 0 is the top of the safe area.
- **Light and shadow:** light comes from the top-left, and shadows are offset (+3, +5) (`SHADOW` in gfx.js).
- **Balls:**
  - radius 6 (titan 10);
  - speed 345 × `opt.speed` × the rally ramp (up to 1.28);
  - the ball is lost at `drainY = paddle.y + 20`; the missed-ball shield plane is `paddle.y + 18`.
- **Paddle:**
  - y is `paddleY(H, minY, uiScale) = round(max(minY, H - 126 / uiScale))`;
  - base width 74 in both current levels;
  - no heavy lower deck/track; debris, drops and bolts are clipped/culled before `playClipY = H - 64 / uiScale`.
- **Grid cells:** a `Uint8Array` of kinds and a parallel `hp` array.
  - The Vault adds `bid` (cell → brick id) because its bricks span 2 cells.
  - The Vault declares `unpierceable = [GRANITE, BARS]`. FIRE/TITAN bounce from those kinds and pierce ordinary bricks. Other levels keep their original piercing behaviour. Solid-corner normals ignore neighbouring pierced cells.
  - Aim preview carries the caught ball's titan flag and current FIRE state and retains `unpierceable` when cloning the grid.
- **Fallbacks:** every rendered sprite has a code-drawn fallback, checked with `ready(spr)`.
- **Debris:** planck uses 16 world units = 1 m, gravity 34 m/s², and `MAX_PIECES` 140.

### Level 1: Invasion (`src/invasion.js`)

- **Grid:** 11 × 9 cells of 28 × 18 units, centred, starting at y = 92.
- **Cell kinds:** `CANDY` 1 hp, `ARMOR` 3 hp, `POWERB` 1 hp (drops a power-up), `BOT` 2 hp (a robot).
- **March:** step every `t` seconds, ±14 units horizontally, then down 14 at each edge. The interval shortens as cells die.
- **Robots:**
  - they fire with a 0.45 s angry windup, and the shooter is biased toward the paddle;
  - per-cell mood timers drive the face: `angry`, `laugh`, `shock`, `dizzy`, `hurt`, or the `march0/1` cycle;
  - a killed robot drops as a rigid body (`meta.robot`); catching it scores +120.
- **Boss:** 36 HP, an elliptical hitbox (44 × 18 plus the ball radius), bombs, and a mood pair `[name, t]`.
- **Visuals:**
  - background is the `invPlate` render, `drawHazard()` draws the hazard line, the HUD is the FORMATION or MOTHERSHIP bar;
  - sprites: `inv_bot_<white|pink|yellow|blue>_<expr>`, `inv_mothership_<smug|angry|hurt|panic|dizzy>`, `inv_mothership_lights_0/1`, `inv_bolt`, `inv_bomb`, `inv_brick_c_<row>_<dmg>`, `inv_brick_a_<dmg>`, `inv_brick_p_0`.

### Level 2: The Vault (`src/vault.js`)

- **Grid:** 20 × 20 cells of 16 units, origin (20, 96). The ASCII `LAYOUT` is in the file. Glazed bricks are 2 cells wide in running bond.
- **Brick kinds:** SUN, CORAL, VIOLET, TEAL, BLUE, GOLD (gem, drops a power-up), GRANITE (indestructible anchor), BARS (cage).
- **Selected mixed layout:** 219 brick objects, 245 normal-hit HP and 19 deliberate gem targets. Staggered granite requires aiming-side changes. The left SPLIT support and right FIRE support each release eight hanging bricks; collapsed gems do not automatically issue powers.
- **Serpent state:** `{cells, hist, chew, chewing, prog, stun, dir, look, faceLeft, path, open, hits, flinch, mood, moodT, alpha, fleeT}`.
  - It plans with Dijkstra (`snakePlan`), with cost equal to chew seconds (`CHEW`) and granite blocked.
  - `expression()` chooses the head face.
  - The body is drawn by `drawSnakeBody()`, a Catmull-Rom tapered ribbon with belly, diamonds and gloss bands.
  - The head uses `ART.snakeJade` (cell 176, unit 44, `expr` and `dir` maps), drawn at 1.45×. Entry permits the full down-facing angle before joining normal turning. The body uses matching jade/ivory/mint colours; the original purple family is preserved.
  - Twelve segments stream down through a dark top tunnel; tail segments stay hidden above the grid and are excluded from ball/laser/debris contacts. Normal movement begins immediately after entry, with growth up to 20 cells. The untouched initial route is 40 steps / cost 65.45998. Measured idle attack/loss are 55.0833/59.7667 seconds after active handover; cinematic time is additional.
  - Two separate incoming ball contact episodes queue fury; lingering overlap and simultaneous volley contacts cannot instantly fill both hits. Head hits retain their existing stun/knockback; body hits retain flinch/chew setback. Those reactions finish before a 1.4-second marked wind-up, organic spray and 1.2-second recovery. No opening attack occurs without hits.
  - Venom chooses one exposed useful granite partition within 68 units, protecting the cage roof/frame/bars. Failed defence can melt the real brick and trigger support collapse; guarded defence preserves that target for this volley. The spray has irregular pulsing streams, droplets and splashes. Fury waits while moving if no useful target is available. World mutation stops after a loss.
  - First eligible full-charge warning pauses world time for the contextual Ward lesson. Kit's presentation clock keeps animating. A valid charged cast acknowledges `wardCoachAck` and resumes the real volley, with no practice currency or free charge. Intro-skip touches/Space are consumed through release.
- **Collapse:** a flood fill from anchors (granite, bars, the edge columns, the top row). Unanchored bricks are converted into `debris.drop` rigid bodies.
- **Phases:** `intro` (camera zoom), then `rescue`, then `escape` (princess runs the breach path), then `frenzy` (12 balls for 7 s), then won. Losing goes to `caught`.
- **Princess:** `PRINCESS` sheet (cell 168, unit 56, feet 4, `anims {name: {row, n}}`), played at 14 fps by `play(anim, loop)` and `updatePrincess()`.
- **Background:** calm dark castle plate; torches and lantern effects were removed in the earlier polish pass.

### Prince Kit

- `art/kit.py` builds selected Knight 2 from `kk_Knight.glb`: continuous cheek/jaw skin, open silver helmet, cobalt costume, broad shield fitted behind the hand and a surface-fitted face rig.
- 100 frames across Idle, Focus, Grin, Shock, Worried, Cheer, Hurt and Laugh. 168 × 168 RGBA, 56-unit cell, roughly 42-unit character, feet margin 4, 14 fps. Shock/Hurt hold their final frame; the other clips loop.
- `tools/pack_art.py` validates clips against `assets/kit/meta.json` and packs `ART.kit`, including eight 288-pixel portraits in `faces` (columns match the animation row indices). `drawKit()` selects body frames; `drawKitFace()` selects portraits.
- Selected UI A is a 52 CSS pixel left face orb with circular charge. A full charge opens one 12-second expressive body window, fitted within the same corner footprint. A later cast can reopen a receded body; an active window does not continually refresh. Receding consumes no unused charge. Kit's presentation clock also runs during the paused first-use lesson.
- Vault reserves the existing 12-brick charge for Ward. During the marked warning, a deliberate orb tap starts a 0.18-second shield transfer and spends once; protection lasts for the volley, not the 12-second character display. Invasion retains centre-return Titan; its orb gives the corresponding hint. Hero levels, store and chapter progression are still plans.
- The native input layer owns paddle and Kit pointer IDs independently: crossing drags, out-and-back gestures and cancellation cannot cast, and a second-finger orb tap preserves the paddle drag. Orb and complete grip envelope have 8 CSS pixel separation on both requested phone sizes.
- Source proofs, eight portraits, a rendered turnaround and an animated preview are documented in `design/phase1/01-kit-character.md` and its manifest. Rejected creature production is archived outside active assets in ignored `out/rejected-cast-20261018/`.

## 3. Art pipeline (Blender, `art/`)

**Setup:**
- `python3 -m pip install bpy==5.2.2 pillow numpy`, which needs Python 3.13 and runs headless. The previous Python 3.11 instruction was incompatible with this pinned release.
- `art/princess.py` resolves its output directory to an absolute path before passing it to Blender, so relative command-line outputs stay inside the caller's working directory on Windows.
- Cycles on CPU. Set threads to 2 if running two jobs in parallel on 4 cores.
- Colour management: AgX, look "Medium High Contrast". Orthographic camera; key area light top-left.

### Commands

| Command | What it produces |
|---|---|
| `python3 art/render_vault_assets.py all` | Vault plate, bars and sprites (args `all\|plate\|bars\|sprites\|post`, plus `--fast`) |

| `python3 art/snake.py assets/snake-jade --palette jade --dirs r,l --samples 64 --px 4 --threads 2` | Matching jade head family, preserving original purple assets |
| `python3 tools/pack_art.py` | Packs active rendered families into `src/vault-art.js` as WebP data URIs (quality about 86–90); current registry about 1.91 MB |
| `npm run build` | Builds `dist/breach.html` and `dist/breach-artifact.html` |

### Output conventions

- **Sprites:**
  - 3 px per world unit, with the margin given in each `atlas.json` entry (usually 4 units);
  - `drawSize = px / 3`;
  - bricks are drawn at `(x - margin, y - margin)` with size `(w + 2·margin, h + 2·margin)`.
- **Plates:** 2 px per unit, covering y from -40 to 780; draw them at (0, -40) with size 360 × 820.
- **Asset folders:**

  | Folder | Contents |
  |---|---|
  | `assets/vault/` | `atlas.json`, `plate`, `bars`, `brick_<y\|c\|v\|t\|b>_<1\|2>_<dmg>`, `brick_gold_1_0`, `brick_granite_*`, `ball`, `ball_fire`, `ball_titan` (new), `paddle_l/m/r`, `cap_<split\|fire\|wide\|focus\|burst\|laser\|shield\|slow\|shrink>`, `lantern`, `torch_flame` |
  | `assets/invasion/` | `atlas.json` plus the sprites listed above |
  | `assets/princess/` | `<Anim>_NN.png` frames (168 px cells after packing) |
  | `assets/kit/` | 100 `<Clip>_NN.png` frames, `meta.json`, portraits, expression/turnaround/contact sheets and animated preview |
  | `assets/snake/` | `head_<expr>_<r\|l>.png` and `meta.json` |
  | `assets/snake-jade/` | 26 jade head renders and matching palette metadata |
  | `assets/models/` | KayKit CC0 GLBs (Knight, Mage, Rogue); the princess is built from Rogue |

### Character rules

The owner has given feedback on several rounds of character drafts.

- **Serpent:**
  - an angular, faceted head, never round or "bally";
  - pink brows, so expressions read;
  - shader-painted iris with lids;
  - expressions: idle, blink, taste, hunt, chew0, chew1, hiss, ouch, dizzy, shock, grin; snarl and strike are being added.
- **Princess:**
  - a tiara with a rose gem, big expressive eyes with lids and brows, and a bell skirt;
  - every animation has a matching face.
- **Robots:** glossy toy robots in 4 colours with 7 expressions.
- **Mothership:** a saucer with an alien face and 5 expressions.

### Before committing renders

Strip PNG text metadata, because Blender embeds the source .blend path:

```
python3 -c "import glob;from PIL import Image;[Image.open(f).save(f) for f in glob.glob('assets/**/*.png',recursive=True)]"
```

Then run `pack_art.py` and the build again.

## 4. Build, test, publish

- **Build:** `npm install`, then `npm run build`. The bundler is esbuild (`tools/build.mjs`), output is a single minified IIFE, currently about 2.23 MB including Kit body/face atlases and the jade head family.
- **Unit tests:** `npm test` runs 21 tests across physics, Kit presentation/input rules and serpent contact/target/entry/ward rules.
- **Playtests:**
  - `node tools/playtest/kit.mjs out/kit-orb-final-qa`: both phone sizes, eight face/body reactions, touch/Focus/secondary-finger input, Invasion Titan/Vault charge reservation, presence expiry, loss/continue and win paths.
  - `node tools/playtest/venom.mjs out/venom-coach-final`: real orb input, full/empty/missed/late/cancel outcomes, hit accounting, hidden tail, protected cage, first-use pause/resume, terminal immutability and held intro-skip regressions.
  - `node tools/playtest/vault-v2.mjs out/vault-ward-final`: mixed-layout support/path/cache/power checks, complete seeded rallies with legal Ward casts, idle loss, streaming intro and result captures. A bot win proves reachability, not human difficulty balance.
  - `node tools/playtest/layout.mjs <out>` and `node tools/playtest/polish.mjs <out> ios|android`: existing layout/polish regression suites.
  - Playwright with Chromium: `node tools/playtest/vault.mjs <outDir> ios|android` and `node tools/playtest/l1.mjs <outDir>`.
  - Both need `<outDir>/shots/` to exist. They drive the game through `window.__breach` (a simple autopilot bot sets `level.ptr`).
  - Device sizes: iPhone 393 × 852 with `?safe=59,34`; Android 412 × 915 with `?safe=32,24`; device scale factor 2.
  - Always check for page errors, and screenshot the serve, play, power-ups, loss/continue and win screens for both devices.
- **Publish the playable build:** the host currently used is a claude.ai Artifact (see doc 03). Publish `dist/breach-artifact.html` (the body fragment).
  - On another host, use `dist/breach.html` as-is: any static hosting works, for example GitHub Pages.
- **Mobile wrapping (future):** Capacitor or a WebView wrapper around `dist/breach.html`. `viewport-fit=cover` and `env(safe-area-inset-*)` are already handled.
